description: "WireSocket dataplane HTTP and WebSocket endpoints."
---

The WireSocket dataplane exposes three endpoints for tenant applications. All endpoints are available in every deployed region.

## Base URL
```
https://{region}.ws.wiresocket.com
```

Replace `{region}` with your target region (e.g. `eu`). Use the [Discovery API](/api-reference/discovery) to resolve the correct region for a document before connecting.

## Authentication

All endpoints require a valid JWT access token issued by the WireSocket control plane. See [Authentication](/authentication) for how to obtain and refresh tokens.
