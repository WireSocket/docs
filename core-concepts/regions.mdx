WireSocket has two distinct region concepts. Understanding the difference is important for setting up your app correctly.

---

## License Region vs WebSocket Region

| | License Region | WebSocket Region |
|---|---|---|
| **Purpose** | Where your app's license and plan data is stored | Where your editors connect for real-time sync |
| **Set when** | App creation — cannot be changed | Per document, at first connection |
| **Claim** | `licenseRegionCode` in JWT | Not in JWT — tracked by you |
| **Affects** | Billing, limits, token issuance | Latency, document pinning |

These are independent. Your license can be stored in EU while your users sync through a US node.

---

## Available Regions

### License Regions

| Code | Location |
|---|---|
| `aws-eu-west-1` | Europe (Ireland) |

### WebSocket Regions

| Region | URL | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Europe | `wss://eu.ws.wiresocket.com` | ✅ Live |
| United States | `wss://us.ws.wiresocket.com` | 🔜 Coming soon |
| Asia Pacific | `wss://apac.ws.wiresocket.com` | 🔜 Coming soon |

Current region URLs are also listed in your [dashboard](https://app.wiresocket.com).

<Info>
  A programmatic regions API is planned for after the v1 beta release. Until then, region URLs are available in the dashboard and this documentation.

## Choosing a Region

WireSocket does not automatically route clients to the optimal region. **You choose the region** and store it alongside the document in your database.

The goal is to pick the region **closest to the majority of your collaborators** for that document. A team working from Europe should use the EU node. A team in the US should use the US node once available.

A common pattern is to encode the region in your document share URL:
```js
// When creating a document, pick the region and store it
const region = 'eu' // your logic to pick based on user location
const docUrl = `https://yourapp.com/doc/${docId}?region=${region}`

// When opening a document from a share link
const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)
const region = params.get('region') ?? 'eu' // default to EU
const wsUrl = `wss://${region}.ws.wiresocket.com`
```

This ensures all collaborators on a shared document connect to the same region automatically.

---

## Document Pinning

Once a document session starts in a region, it is **pinned to that region** for the lifetime of the session.

If a client attempts to connect to a different region for an active document, the connection is rejected with:
```
Close Code: 4009
Close Reason: REDIRECT:wss://<correct-node-url>
```

Handle this in your client to transparently reroute:
```js
provider.ws.addEventListener('close', async (event) => {
  if (event.code === 4009 && event.reason.startsWith('REDIRECT:')) {
    const correctUrl = event.reason.replace('REDIRECT:', '')

    // Save the correct region to your DB
    await updateDocumentRegion(docId, correctUrl)

    // Reconnect to correct region
    const token = await getAccessToken()
    reconnect(correctUrl, docId, token)
  }
})
```

See [Dataplane & Editor Setup](/core-concepts/dataplane) for the full reconnection implementation.

## Why One Region Per Document?

Keeping a document pinned to a single region avoids the complexity and cost of cross-region CRDT merging. Latency within a region is predictable and fast. Cross-region sync introduces coordination overhead that is difficult to reason about and expensive to operate reliably.

If your users are globally distributed, the recommended approach is to pick the region closest to the **document owner** or **primary author**, not the region of every collaborator.
