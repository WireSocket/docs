The WireSocket dataplane is a globally distributed set of WebSocket nodes. This page covers how to connect your editor, handle regions, and manage token renewal and reconnection.

---

## Regions

WireSocket has two region concepts you need to understand:

**License Region** — Set during app creation. Defines where your app's license and plan data is stored. This is the `licenseRegionCode` claim in your JWT. Currently available:

| Code | Location |
|---|---|
| `aws-eu-west-1` | Europe (Ireland) |

**WebSocket Regions** — Where your editors connect for real-time sync. Each region has its own URL:
```
wss://<region>.ws.wiresocket.com
```

Currently available WebSocket regions and their URLs are listed in your [dashboard](https://app.wiresocket.com). More regions (US, APAC) are coming soon.

<Info>
  License Region and WebSocket region are independent. Your license can be stored in EU while your editors connect to a US node.
</Info>

## Document Pinning & Region Routing

A document session exists in **exactly one WebSocket region** at a time — the region where the first client connected.

**You are responsible for tracking which region a document is open in.** WireSocket does not provide a lookup API for this. Store the region alongside the document in your own database when a session starts.

If a client connects to the wrong region, the node rejects the handshake and returns a redirect:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| WebSocket Close Code | `4009` |
| Close Reason | `REDIRECT:wss://<target-node-url>` |

**Example:**

A document is open in `us-west`. A client connects to `apac`. The APAC node closes the connection with:
```
Close Code: 4009
Close Reason: REDIRECT:wss://us-west.ws.wiresocket.com
```

Parse the `REDIRECT:` prefix in your client to automatically reconnect to the correct node without showing an error to the user.

**Fallback:** If the document is active in another region but no specific node URL is found, the close reason will be:
```
Document active in region: us-west
```

In this case, construct the regional URL yourself and retry.

## Document ID Format

Pass any string as your document ID. WireSocket handles isolation internally by prefixing it with `tenantId::appId::` before it reaches the storage layer.

**Recommendations:**
- Keep document IDs under **255 characters**
- Use URL-safe characters — alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores
- Avoid control characters or null bytes
```js
// Good
'my-document-123'
'user_notes_abc'

// Avoid
'doc with spaces'
'doc/with/slashes'
```

## Connecting Your Editor

### TipTap
```js
import * as Y from 'yjs'
import { WebsocketProvider } from 'y-websocket'
import { Editor } from '@tiptap/core'
import Collaboration from '@tiptap/extension-collaboration'
import CollaborationCursor from '@tiptap/extension-collaboration-cursor'

const ydoc = new Y.Doc()

const provider = new WebsocketProvider(
  'wss://eu.ws.wiresocket.com',
  'your-document-id',
  ydoc,
  {
    protocols: ['Bearer', 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN']
  }
)

const editor = new Editor({
  extensions: [
    Collaboration.configure({ document: ydoc }),
    CollaborationCursor.configure({ provider }),
  ],
})
```

### y-websocket (framework agnostic)
```js
import * as Y from 'yjs'
import { WebsocketProvider } from 'y-websocket'

const ydoc = new Y.Doc()

const provider = new WebsocketProvider(
  'wss://eu.ws.wiresocket.com',
  'your-document-id',
  ydoc,
  {
    protocols: ['Bearer', 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN']
  }
)

provider.on('status', event => {
  console.log('Connection status:', event.status)
})
```

---

## Passing the Token

Three methods are supported. All work in all regions.

| Method | How |
|---|---|
| WebSocket Subprotocol (recommended) | `protocols: ['Bearer', 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN']` |
| Query Parameter | `wss://eu.ws.wiresocket.com?token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` |
| Auth Header | `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` |

The subprotocol method is preferred — it keeps the token out of server access logs and browser history.

<Warning>
  The `Origin` header is validated against the `allowed_domains` in your JWT at handshake time. Connections from unlisted domains are rejected before the handshake completes.
</Warning>

---

## Token Expiry & Reconnection

JWT validation happens **at handshake only**. Once connected, an expiring token does not drop an active session. This prevents disruption during live collaboration.

When your token is close to expiry, reconnect with a fresh token:
```js
async function connectWithFreshToken(docId, getAccessToken) {
  const token = await getAccessToken() // fetch or refresh your token

  const provider = new WebsocketProvider(
    'wss://eu.ws.wiresocket.com',
    docId,
    ydoc,
    {
      protocols: ['Bearer', token]
    }
  )

  return provider
}
```

<Info>
  Reconnecting re-validates the JWT against the JWKS endpoint and re-reads plan limits from the token claims. This is the correct way to pick up plan changes or credential rotations.
</Info>

**Recommendation:** Set a proactive reconnect timer slightly before token expiry to avoid gaps. For example, reconnect at 13 minutes if your token expires at 15.

---

## Handling Wrong-Region Errors

Implement a close handler to catch `4009` and automatically reroute:
```js
provider.ws.addEventListener('close', async (event) => {
  if (event.code === 4009 && event.reason.startsWith('REDIRECT:')) {
    const targetUrl = event.reason.replace('REDIRECT:', '')

    // Update stored region for this document in your DB
    await saveDocumentRegion(docId, targetUrl)

    // Reconnect to correct region
    const token = await getAccessToken()
    reconnect(targetUrl, docId, token)
  }
})
```

---

## Connection Limits

Limits are enforced at handshake. If a limit is reached, the connection is rejected before it is established — no active connections are dropped.

| Limit | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| `maxConnections` | Rejected at handshake if global count is at cap |
| `maxUsersPerDoc` | Rejected at handshake if document user count is at cap |
| `opsPerMinute` | Rate limited during active session |

When a connection is rejected due to limits, handle it gracefully in your editor UI and surface a meaningful message to the user.
