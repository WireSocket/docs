WireSocket is a **stateless, edge-deployed sync infrastructure** for collaborative applications. It handles real-time Yjs document synchronization across globally distributed nodes — without storing your data.

You own the data. We own the pipes.

## How It Works

WireSocket is compatible with the [Yjs](https://yjs.dev) CRDT protocol and any Yjs-compatible provider. When a user opens a collaborative document, WireSocket:

1. Verifies the JWT access token issued by your OAuth 2 application
2. Routes the connection to the correct regional node where the document session lives
3. Synchronizes all CRDT updates in real-time across every connected client in that region

**WireSocket does not persist documents.** When the last user disconnects, the session ends. Your application is responsible for saving document state to your own database.

## Tenancy & Authentication

To use WireSocket, you:

1. Sign up and create an **OAuth 2 application** in the WireSocket dashboard
2. Use your `client_id` and `client_secret` to obtain a short-lived **JWT access token**
3. Pass the token when connecting your Yjs provider to the WireSocket WebSocket endpoint

Tokens are stateless and verified at the edge. We never see your users' passwords or raw data.

## Regional Architecture

WireSocket nodes are deployed globally across multiple regions. However, **a document session exists in exactly one region at a time** — the region where the first client connected.

If a subsequent client attempts to connect to a different region for the same document, WireSocket will return an error indicating the correct region. Your client should reconnect to the correct regional endpoint.

This design keeps latency predictable and avoids the complexity and cost of cross-region CRDT merging.

## Compatible With

WireSocket speaks the Yjs sync protocol. Any library or editor that supports Yjs works out of the box.

## What WireSocket Is Not

- ❌ Not a document storage service
- ❌ Not an editor or UI component
- ❌ Not a platform with per-user management
- ❌ Not a lock-in strategy

If you stop using WireSocket, change the WebSocket URL. Your documents are in your database.
## Zero Vendor Lock-In

WireSocket is just a WebSocket endpoint. Your documents live in your database, your auth lives in your system, and your editor stays exactly as it is.

Migrating away from WireSocket means changing one URL. That's it.
```js
// Today
const provider = new WebsocketProvider('wss://ws.wiresocket.com', docId, ydoc)

// Self-hosted or switched provider
const provider = new WebsocketProvider('wss://your-own-server.com', docId, ydoc)
```

No data export requests. No migration tools. No lock-in by design.

We stay competitive by being good infrastructure, not by making it painful to leave.
