## Architecture

WireSocket nodes are **stateless**. Each regional cluster runs multiple nodes backed by a single Redis instance in high-availability mode. Because all session state lives in Redis and not on individual nodes, any node in a region can serve any document in that region at any time.

When a node becomes unhealthy, DNS load balancing automatically routes new connections to healthy nodes in the same cluster. This transition is invisible to your users — no client-side failover logic is required.

---

## Automatic Load Shedding

WireSocket nodes continuously monitor memory, CPU load, and active connection count. When a node approaches its limits, it automatically removes itself from the DNS routing pool and stops accepting new connections.

DNS load balancing ensures all new connections are routed to healthy nodes in the cluster automatically — no client-side handling or reconnection logic is required for node-level health events.

**What this means for your application:**

- **Zero dropped sessions** — Existing active sessions are never dropped during a node health event. Current users finish their work undisturbed.
- **Transparent DNS steering** — New connections are transparently routed to healthy nodes by DNS as soon as a node reaches its high-water mark of 80% occupancy.
- **Automatic recovery** — Once a node's memory or connection count returns to safe levels, it automatically re-enters the pool without any intervention.
- **Thundering herd protection** — Rejected connection attempts receive a jittered `Retry-After` instruction, preventing massive reconnection spikes from overwhelming healthy nodes during a regional shift.

In the rare event that all nodes in a region become unavailable simultaneously, the entire cluster becomes unreachable. In this case, connect to a different available region and monitor [status.wiresocket.com](https://status.wiresocket.com) for recovery updates.
