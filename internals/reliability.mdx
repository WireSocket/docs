## Architecture

WireSocket nodes are **stateless**. Each regional cluster runs multiple nodes backed by a single Redis instance in high-availability mode. Because all session state lives in Redis and not on individual nodes, any node in a region can serve any document in that region at any time.

When a node becomes unhealthy, DNS load balancing automatically routes new connections to healthy nodes in the same cluster. This transition is invisible to your users — no client-side failover logic is required.

---

## Automatic Load Shedding

WireSocket nodes continuously monitor memory, CPU load, and active connection count. When a node approaches its limits, it automatically removes itself from the DNS routing pool and stops accepting new connections.

**What this means for your application:**

- Existing active sessions are never dropped during a node health event
- New connection attempts during a health event receive a `503` response with a `Retry-After` header
- Once the node recovers, it re-enters the pool automatically

Handle `503` on connection with a backoff retry:
```js
provider.ws.addEventListener('close', async (event) => {
  if (event.code === 1011) {
    // Node unavailable — retry after jittered delay
    const retryAfter = 30 + Math.random() * 10
    await sleep(retryAfter * 1000)
    reconnect(nodeUrl, docId, token)
  }
})
```
