## 1. Sign Up

Create your WireSocket account at [dashboard.wiresocket.com](https://dashboard.wiresocket.com).

Your tenant account is free. No credit card required to get started.

---

## 2. Create an OAuth 2 Application

To connect to the WireSocket dataplane, a **JWT access token** is required. Tokens are issued through an **OAuth 2 Machine-to-Machine (M2M)** flow — to set this up, you first need to create an OAuth 2 app in the dashboard.
<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Apps section">
    Navigate to **Apps** in the dashboard sidebar and click **Create App**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your app">
    Give your app a name that identifies the product or service connecting to WireSocket (e.g. `my-editor-prod`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set the License Region">
    Choose the **License Region** for this app. This defines where your app's license and plan data is stored.

    <Warning>
      The License Region cannot be changed after the app is created. Choose the region closest to your primary user base.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign a plan">
    Select a plan for this app. Your **first app is free**. All subsequent apps require a paid plan assigned at creation.

    Your app cannot connect to the WireSocket dataplane until a plan is assigned.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save your credentials">
    After creation, copy your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** immediately. The secret is shown only once.

    <Warning>
      Never expose your `client_secret` in browser code or public repositories. It is a server-side credential only.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Get an Access Token

Exchange your credentials for a JWT access token from your **backend server**.
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.wiresocket.com/connect/token \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
  -d "client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID" \
  -d "client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"\
  -d "scope=WireSocket.API offline_access"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "refresh_token": "eyJ...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 900
}
```

<Info>
  Access tokens are valid for **15 minutes**. Use the `refresh_token` to obtain a new access token without re-authenticating. See [Token Renewal](/authentication) for implementation guidance.
</Info>

The JWT contains your app's plan details and license limits. The WireSocket dataplane reads these claims directly — no database lookup required.

## 4. Connect to the Dataplane

Pass the access token when connecting your Yjs provider to the WireSocket dataplane. Two methods are supported:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="URL Parameter">
```js
    import * as Y from 'yjs'
    import { WebsocketProvider } from 'y-websocket'

    const ydoc = new Y.Doc()

    const provider = new WebsocketProvider(
      'wss://ws.wiresocket.com?access_token=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
      'your-document-id',
      ydoc
    )
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="WebSocket Subprotocol">
```js
    import * as Y from 'yjs'
    import { WebsocketProvider } from 'y-websocket'

    const ydoc = new Y.Doc()

    const provider = new WebsocketProvider(
      'wss://ws.wiresocket.com',
      'your-document-id',
      ydoc,
      {
        WebSocketPolyfill: undefined,
        protocols: ['Bearer', 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN']
      }
    )
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  The subprotocol method is preferred for security as it keeps the token out of server access logs and browser history.
</Info>

## You're Connected

Your Yjs document is now syncing through WireSocket. Any changes made by connected clients are propagated in real-time within the document's region.
